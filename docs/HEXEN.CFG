#[z]	Z coord is ignored
#		(Usually means object is glued to the floor; "Zilch Z")
#[f]	Z coord is height from floor, and is *not* subject to gravity
#		("Flying")
#[F]	Z coord is height from floor, is *not* subject to gravity, and object
#		Floats in the air
#[c]	Z coord is negative height from ceiling, not subject to gravity
#If none of the above are present, Z coord is height from floor, subject to
#gravity (the most common, which usually renders Z of minimal use.)
#[d]	Object can be Destroyed
#[D]	Object can be Destroyed and automatically create another Thing when
#		destroyed (Arg0 = item type to create)
#[b]	Object must be Burnt to destroy it (non-fiery hits do not affect it)
#[p]	Object runs its special with an activating Player, so specials like
#		Damage can be used
#[+]	Object is activatable
#[-]	Object is deactivatable
#[s]	Object is Spawnable (see spawnable things)
